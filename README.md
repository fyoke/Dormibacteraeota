# Dormibacteraeota

Dormibacteraeota is a bacterial phylum that was newly discovered in XXX (20XX). Since then, it was also discovered in:
- Thawing permafrost, Arctic (Woodcroft, 2018)
- Termite mound, XXX (XXX, 20XX)
- etc

### Aim

With the increasing availability of public metagenomes and Dormibacteraeota MAGs, we are set out apply computational methods to investigate it's diversity and ecology using phylogenomics and metapangenomics methods.

### TODO

- Fill in input_folder/genomes with genomes (fasta)
- Fill in input_folder/genome_metadata.tsv (easy edit with Excel)
	- I am trying to follow this format (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.25.461819, Table 1)
- Fill in list of metagenomes in input_folder/metagenome_metadata.tsv (not priority yet)
	- For this one, just get list of papers on soil metagenomes first
	- Start with a few, we can expand later
	- When ready, I'll show how to make it simpler
